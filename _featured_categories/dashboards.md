# East Australia Gas Fundamentals

This is a live dashboard that scrapes east Australia gas data twice daily and visualizes it through a Shiny app. I created this during a stint as a commodities reporter because I needed a daily overview of gas fundamentals and the data was unfortunately scattered everywhere. These days I maintain it purely as part of my portfolio.
