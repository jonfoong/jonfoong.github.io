# Academic projects

In my time at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB) I was involved in a number of academic projects, all of which are at various stages of the publishing cycle.

<a href="/projects/kenya_int/"> **Intersectional Discrimination and Candidate Selection: Evidence from a Lab Experiment 
in Kenya** </a> <br> *- with Macartan Humphreys, Lukas Antoine, Heiko Giebler, and Rasmus Ollroge*<br>

<a href="/projects/lib_conjoint/"> **Liberalism in retreat? Assessing preference for liberal values through a large N conjoint experiment** </a> <br> *- with Macartan Humphreys and Kimuli Kasara*<br>

# Software

I contribute to the following software packages

<a href="https://github.com/jonfoong/Rinteract/" target='_blank'>**Rinteract**</a>: return and graph conditional effects in regression models with interactions <br>

*Author, maintainer*<br>

# Dashboards

Data is all around us, yet too often it is either scattered or presented in ways that turn off mass publics. I believe dashboards are a good solution to this. Here are some dashboards I have worked on or are in the works. 

<a href="/projects/aus_gas_dashboard/"> **East Australia Gas Fundamentals** </a> <br>
*- A live dashboard that scrapes and visualizes gas data in East Australia* 

**Singapore Parliament Speeches** (*coming soon!*)
