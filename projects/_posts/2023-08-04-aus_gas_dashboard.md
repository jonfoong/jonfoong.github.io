This is a live dashboard that scrapes east Australia gas data twice daily and visualizes it through a Shiny app. I created this during a stint as a commodities reporter because I needed a daily overview of gas fundamentals and the data was unfortunately scattered everywhere. These days I maintain it purely as part of my portfolio. You can also access the dashboard <a href="https://jonfoong.shinyapps.io/ausdashboard/" target='_blank'> here </a>.
